    "It has a sticker that says **\"REMOVE SEAL NEXT\"** (or just a sticker). \n",
    "*   **How it works:** You give it power, it BEEPS. That's it.\n",
    "*   **Pros:** Easy to use.\n",
    "*   **Cons:** Can only make one boring tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Passive Buzzer \n",
    "It usually has a green circuit board visible on the bottom.\n",
    "*   **How it works:** It acts like a tiny speaker. You have to send it a specific frequency (vibration speed) to make a sound.\n",
    "*   **Pros:** Can play music (Super Mario, Star Wars, etc.)!\n",
    "*   **Cons:** Needs code to tell it what note to play."
